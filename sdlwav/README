    run "make"

THE PROGRAMS
~~~~~~~~~~~~

sdlwav.c
    demonstrates:
		open/close of SDL_mixer
		Mix_SetPostMix
		Mix_QuerySpec
		Mix_LoadMUS
		Mix_PlayMusic
		Mix_RewindMusic
		Mix_VolumeMusic
		Mix_GetMusicType
		Mix_SetMusicPosition (for mp3 only)
		detection of when music ends
		draws a Wave from the output data

    try:
		./sdlwav song.mp3
		./sdlwav song.ogg
		./sdlwav song.mod (mod can be one of a number of extentions)
		./sdlwav somefile 8 1
			this uses 8 bits, default is 8, try 0!
			the last 1 turns on fullscreen, any 3rd argument will do that

	usage:
		the song files are not distributed with the demo, use whatever ones you have.
		left arrow key rewinds the music
		right arrow key fasts forwards 5 seconds (for mp3 only)
		up and down arrows adjust volume (very roughly)
		if you want, edit the source, and change the BUFFER H and W values.
