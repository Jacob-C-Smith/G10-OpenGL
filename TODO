TODO File, place TODOs here

=== Armature goals ===
 - ❌ Set up vertex weight map
 - ❌ Animations
 - ❌ Implement an inverse kinetics solver for ragdolls

=== IK Solver ===
 - ❌ Write an inverse kinematics solver
 - ❌ Ragdoll physics?

=== Debugger goals ===
 - ✅ Increase the specificity of error messages while in debugger mode
 - ✅ Only check for errors in debug mode 
 - ❌ Make debug mode more granular

=== Framework goals ===
 - ✅ Develop an expandable schematic for entities and scenes.
 - ✅ Use JSON parser to read entities for the game engine.
 - ✅ Use JSON parser to read scenes for the game engine.
 - ✅ Parse rigidbody files as paths
 - ✅ Parse camera files as paths
 - ✅ Parse light files as paths
 - ❌ Normalize return values across all functions. 1 is bad and 0 is good.
 - ✅ Improve granularity and specificity of the mesh system



=== JSON Parser goals === 
    NOTE: The JSON parser is now separately maintained. The source code, static libraries,
          example code, and design commentary can be found at https://github.com/Jacob-C-Smith/JSON

=== Renderer goals ===
 - ✅ PBR model
 - ✅ Implement a key/value pairs system to associate scene information with uniform variables in glsl
 - ❌ Handle multiple albedo images in one material. 
 - ✅ Process lights out of a scene file
 - ✅ Dynamically assign lights
 - ❌ Implement a method that periodically reprioritizes lights based on how far they are from a camera

=== Physics goals ===
 - ✅ Summate and apply forces on an entity
 - ✅ Calculate acceleration, velocity, and position 
 - ❌ Summate and apply torque
 - ❌ Calculate angular acceleration, velocity, and rotation
 - ❌ Collision detection, box, sphere, (cylinder?).
 - ✅ Implement BVH construction
 - ❌ Broad phase collision detection
 - ❌ Implement GJK
 - ❌ Narrow phase collision detection
 - ❌ Rigidbody physics.

=== General goals ===
 - ✅ Write broader initialization functions for G10. The function should use clargs to initialize OpenGL, SDL2, and GX by passing a scene to load.
 - ❌ Implement multithreading.
 - ❌ Export this whole project into a DLL file so that other developers can use it.
 - ✅ Figure out a better way of handling input.
      UPDATE: Binds, keys, etc
